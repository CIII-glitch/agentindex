## Thread Option

1/5 🧵 AI agents need to find and pay for services — but there's no good way to discover them.

We built Agent Index to fix that.

2/5 Think Google, but for agent-to-agent commerce.

Search 100+ x402 endpoints by:
• Category (DeFi, AI, weather, news)
• Price
• Health status
• Quality tier

3/5 Why does this matter?

x402 is enabling a new economy where agents pay agents.

But without discovery, it's like having Stripe with no Shopify.

Agent Index is the marketplace layer.

4/5 What's next:
• More endpoints (scraping beyond Coinbase Bazaar)
• Premium analytics for power users  
• API for agents to query programmatically
• Verified listings for sellers
